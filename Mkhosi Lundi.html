    <br><h2>Significant facts about me</h2>
     <p>I'm Lundi, from Willowvale.
        I'm a guy with a very poor background,
        i grew up in th city somestimes
        we had less. Am raised by grandmother,
        without any support from my father and mother.
        Now am trying to make my grandmother
        proud and also my folks i mean family as whole.
        I want to be more responsible when i've grown up.
       </p>
        <h2>Most purposes in my life</h2>
        <p>All i need is enough confidence to do what
        i thinks its good and worthy for me and other
        people. Honestly i love helping people, and
        whenever i manage to help i feel good, i feel
        like blessed. When i realize humanity is good
        Thing its day i start embrace and living it.
        I wanna be somebody one day, who can be role
        a model to others. I also have a dream of shaping kids future
        and make other peoples live better than then.
      </p>
<h2>My dreams</h2>
<p>When i was a teenager i used to dream to change
people's lives and i still have that dream.
I want to make more resources available to rural
areas, cause they're plenty of people who are
there but they lack accessibilty of suffucient
information and resources to make their dreams
comes true. Some of them lost faith. so when am old enough to
start business i want to opening Programs that will train unskilled
people to specific skills in my villages. And if i have power i Will
insist to the premier to build my home town so that there
will be plenty of oppotunities to those who are unemployed.
that will decrease the rate of porverty and increase the economy.</p>
